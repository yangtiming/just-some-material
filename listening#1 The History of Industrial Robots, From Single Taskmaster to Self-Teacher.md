what technology has been revolutionizing manufacturing for more than 80 years
5s	it all started earlier than you think in the late 1930s Bill Taylor used
20s	components from a Meccano toy system to build the first pick-and-place
23s	industrial robot known as gargantuan the crane like robot was programmed by paper
28s	tape and powered by a single electric motor and it could staff blocks and
32s	pre-programmed patterns Taylor's design was the beginning of one of history's
36s	most exciting industries revolutionising productivity in the United States
40s	manufacturing sector but it wasn't until after World War two that the first
44s	full-sized industrial robots were produced and put to work where they were
48s	utilized for heavy and repetitive tasks which consisted of relatively simple
52s	motions in 1961 a company called unum ation was established in Connecticut its
58s	founder Joseph angle Berger known as the father of robotics led the development
1:02	of the Univision dust really it didn't take long for the automotive industry to
1:08	take note General Motors incorporated the UNAM 8
1:11	1900 into its manufacturing line where it was used to perform dangerous tasks
1:15	by placing hot metals into cooling liquids and thereby transforming the
1:19	automotive industry by making tasks safer for workers it wasn't long before
1:23	the UNAMID was introduced to the public at a trade show in Chicago and it even
1:28	appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson soon 450 UNAM 819 hundred units
1:34	were in use and by 1966 manufacturers wanted to broaden the customer base
1:39	outside of the US with nokia finland stepping in to manufacture the robots in
1:43	scandinavia and eastern europe in 1969 Unum eight welding robots were brought
1:49	to market they could assemble and weld an amazing 110 cars per hour more than
1:54	double the rate of any automotive plant at the time the next big development
1:58	came when Viktor Scheinman at Stanford University designed the first
2:02	lightweight all-electric multi programmable robotic arm called the
2:06	Stanford Honor it was able to perform jobs that were unpleasant and dangerous
2:09	for workers in 1971 the creation of the first
2:14	fully electrical microprocessor controlled robot was underway
2:17	it had an anthropomorphic structure by 1973 3000 industrial robots were in use
2:23	around the world improving the way workplaces operate every day the design
2:28	then reached new heights when the simple robot arms were used on the Viking 1 and
2:31	Viking 2 Mars Landers they were able to easily scoop surface material and
2:36	transfer it to receptacles on each Lander for tests and analysis the next
2:41	decade saw manufacturers give robots the sense of sight and use them on automated
2:45	assembly lines in conjunction with sensors which used machine vision in the
2:49	positioning orienting and inspecting in the component parts from the mid-1990s
2:54	to the early 2000s advancements in Robotics were evolutionary rather than
2:59	revolutionary in 1994 for example the MRC robot control system was introduced
3:04	editable from an ordinary desktop PC the MRC made it possible to control up to 21
3:10	axes and synchronize the motion of two robots over the next 10 years
3:14	robots evolved to be able to physically interact with people in a shared
3:17	workspace known as cobots these robots could operate with limited guidance and
3:22	lighten accompanies workload by 2012 Amazon purchased the robotics company
3:27	Kiva systems using autonomous mobile robots to automate the material handling
3:31	in its warehouses continued innovation saw a surge in demand and by 2014
3:37	robot sales saw 29 percent increase worldwide and as AI is used more and
3:42	more to control robots the demand continues to grow current research into
3:46	combining machine learning with robotics is exploring how industrial robots can
3:50	train themselves to perform complex tasks and adapt to their surroundings
3:54	the robots ability to solve problems independently has the potential to
3:58	change manufacturing industries as we know them today the automobile industry
4:02	remains the heaviest user of industrial robots with electronics manufacturing
4:06	and second place and chemicals and plastic production in third the unit
4:10	remains one of the most significant contributions to manufacturing in the
4:14	past 100 years the question now is which industry will robotics innovate next
4:20	only time will tell you
