The Ethical Robot
Time	Subtitle
9s	it seems to me we have the opportunity for coming up with a new perspective and
13s	thinking about ethics with machine ethics because what we're gonna think about
17s	is how we want machine robots for example to treat us.
23s	our research began trying to see whether ethics could be computed
28s	how do you even represent ethics in a machine where it's just a bunch of zeros
33s	and ones somehow we have to find a representation scheme
38s	it's a two step process by which we we uh... try to put
41s	ethical principles into a machine
44s	first step is to find out get a principal
46s	we use a technique called machine learning that takes
49s	cases of ethical dilemmas
51s	and feed this information to this machine
55s	and it slowly builds a principle that
59s	covers the correct answer
1:01	it learns features, duties, and is able to discover a decision principal from the
1:08	input given by by the ethicist
1:10	and then we realized we can take it a step further
1:12	to take that principle and put it into
1:14	a robot
1:16	and apply this to a real life situation
1:20	involving a medication reminder system
1:24	so he's looking for a medication you give it to him and here we go. great.
1:28	now he's gonna scan
1:30	and find a patient which is just this logo that he can recognize. this symbol
1:36	now he should see it.
1:38	he saw it.
1:39	now he's going to turn his body
1:42	slowly to the angle where his head was
1:44	and is going to walk over to this patient
1:46	to give this medication to him
1:48	good job
1:54	when he gets close enough to the patient, he will stop.
1:58	it is time to take your medication. no! okay i'll remind you later.
2:06	something as simple as
2:09	telling somebody it's time to take your medication it has ethical ramifications
2:12	you want
2:13	the robot to be sensitive to
2:16	how much good you can get out of it
2:19	how much harm would happen if you didn't take the medication
2:22	it actually that you run right now these are the actual values for how much harm
2:27	over time is happening how much good is
2:29	being lost. but we cannot
2:32	act at all without
2:34	making certain value judgments
2:37	that's behind everything we do it's the most important thing that drives human
2:41	behavior
2:42	and if so since humans often
2:45	fail miserably at being ethical
2:48	if we could program a robot to behave ethically there is a lot of
2:54	potential for
2:55	teaching humans how to behave better
2:58	the rate machines are going
3:03	interacting with the human beinges
3:06	would you like to have something that didn't have ethics telling you what to
3:09	do or helping you out around the house i don't think so
3:11	there've been so many science fiction stories and movies of
3:16	machines that turn against their creators and harm them, if we can reassure the public
3:22	that these machines will
3:24	follow
3:25	intuitively acceptable
3:27	ethical guidelines
3:29	then we feel that the research can advance
3:33	touch the front of my head for yes. the back of my head for no
3:38	i am going to contact the doctor
